# Daedalus ✈️  
_A Parametric Wing Modeling and Aerodynamic Analysis Tool_

## Overview

**Daedalus** is a parametric wing design utility built to streamline early-stage aircraft concept development. The tool allows users to define a wing's geometry through 19 customizable inputs—including chord length, taper ratio, incidence angle, and washout—and export the resulting data points for use in CAD platforms like SolidWorks.

This project is designed as a launchpad for integrating basic aerodynamic analysis directly into the modeling workflow, ultimately reducing time spent toggling between geometry and simulation tools.

## Features

- ⚙️ 19-parameter input system for wing geometry
- 🪶 Support for 4-digit NACA airfoils (proof of concept)
- 📤 Export of airfoil and skin point data
- 💻 CAD-ready output compatible with tools like SolidWorks

## Future Enhancements

- 🌀 Integration of the **Vortex Panel Method** for aerodynamic coefficient estimation
- 📐 Direct export pipeline to CAD platforms using specialized import formatting
- 📊 Real-time visualization of geometry and flow patterns

## Motivation

Daedalus is a passion project developed to bridge the gap between conceptual aerodynamic tools and 3D modeling environments. It serves as a foundation for future full-stack wing design utilities and supports both education and preliminary aircraft design workflows.

## Getting Started

Coming soon — currently under active development.
